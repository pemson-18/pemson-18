# **👋 Hi, I'm Pemson Pereira**

I'm an IT Consultant and Educator who enjoys breaking down technical concepts into simple, practical lessons. With 7+ years of experience in web development, digital solutions, and IT consulting, I’ve worked across platforms like Drupal, PHP, and modern web technologies — but one subject I love teaching the most is **Python**.

Python has been a big part of my learning journey, from completing foundational courses to using it for automation, data tasks, and improving problem-solving skills. My goal is to help beginners and professionals understand Python in a way that feels natural, logical, and fun.
